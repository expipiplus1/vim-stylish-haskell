vim-stylish-haskell
===================

Introduction
------------

This is a plugin to integrate [stylish-haskell] cleanly into your vim
workflow. By default, it will NOT run stylish-haskell on Haskell buffers every
time they are saved. It assumes stylish-haskell is accessible from your $PATH.
If this isn't the case, set the `g:stylish_haskell_command` variable to the
location of the stylish-haskell binary.

Installation
------------

This plugin is compatible with [Vundle.vim] and [pathogen.vim].

[Vundle.vim]: https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim

Enabling Auto Format
--------------------
To enable running at each file save copy the following into your .vimrc

```vimscript
augroup stylish-haskell
  autocmd!
  autocmd BufWritePost *.hs call s:StylishHaskell()
augroup END
```
